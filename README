## Slides for the Report about the German Perl&Raku Workshop 2022

If you want to run the slideshow on your machine, install the perl
module https://metacpan.org/dist/Vroom and then do:
```
cd vroom
vroom vroom
```
It will open vim and you can navigate with <SPACE> (forward) and
<BACKSPACE> (back). To run perl examples, press `RR`.
